Ready to transform your mornings? Let's get started.

#### **H2: Understanding Morning Stiffness in Rheumatoid Arthritis**
**Morning stiffness in RA** is caused by inflammation that builds up overnight. When you're inactive during sleep, inflammatory proteins accumulate in your joints, causing **arthritis morning stiffness** that can last from 30 minutes to several hours.

This **RA morning stiffness** is different from normal morning stiffness because:

Understanding this mechanism helps you target the right **morning stiffness relief** solutions.

**1. Gentle Bed Stretches for RA**
Start your day with gentle stretches while still in bed:
