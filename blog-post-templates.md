Ready to transform your mornings? Let's get started.

#### **H2: Understanding Morning Stiffness in RA**
Morning stiffness in rheumatoid arthritis is caused by inflammation that builds up overnight. When you're inactive during sleep, inflammatory proteins accumulate in your joints, causing stiffness that can last from 30 minutes to several hours.

This stiffness is different from normal morning stiffness because:
- It lasts longer than 30 minutes
- It affects multiple joints symmetrically
- It's accompanied by other RA symptoms like fatigue
- It improves with movement and activity

Understanding this mechanism helps you target the right solutions for relief.
